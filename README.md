Project Aim:
Build a customizable fitness app based on classic, time-tested exercise progression techniques of working muscles largest to smallest order, for maximum workout efficiency. I do this using sorting and other algorithms, and add standout features like YouTube API calls to populated a sidebar with video demos of exercise moves. Added UX via the built-in workout timer. 

The Problem this solves:
Many general fitness apps, that is those not owned by major corporations and (thus unconnected to hardware), are either randomized workouts based only a body part worked or your time available. But these apps often show premanufactured workouts in a random order thatâ€™s not necessarily optimized for results, working your largest muscles to smaller muscles. I want to create a randomized, yet customizable, workout app based on the best training principles.  

Key features: 
Customizable, but randomized exercises from my own JSON file, image demo, workout timers, Hopefully Youtube API scraper, Google or Facebook oAuth.

Technologies I'm using:
YouTube API, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, created my own fitness JSON database.
